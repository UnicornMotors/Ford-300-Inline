With a 1984 F150 300, T18 granny 4 speed and 3.08 axle ratio I once towed a two axle trailer with a 1986 E250 van on it with a bunch of sheet rock inside. Everything together was 11,000 pounds and it definitely felt like it. Another time I towed a 1983 F350 chassis cab dually that weighed 7,000 pounds. I used a huge home made tow bar that is around 8‚Äô long and between 100 and 150 pounds itself. I don‚Äôt remember which 300 powered F150 I used to tow that F350. I owned around a dozen mostly 1981-1986 F150‚Äôs. All but one had the 300-6.

Dang!  12k load for an ol'  ¬æ ton Dent Side?  That's actually really good!  Know a guys who's Ram 3500 reg cab 5.7 SRW that's rated only up to 13,500...but it's a "2018" 4th Gen Lol.  Seemed to be doing just fine, no complaints through out the whole trip from the engine, then again wouldn't expect any less from the mighty 300.   I gotta say dude, it's been a dream to build an old truck with a turbo straight six like yours, and you're the only guy on this whole platform actually doing it, and doing it right.  On top of it, you're keeping in with the traditional styling/function.   

If you keep towing like you do, I see an F350 leaf pack, a 5 link setup up front, and a brownie box in the not too distant future haha. Keep up the great work boss, looking forward to what's coming nextüëç
