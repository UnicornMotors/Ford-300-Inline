With a 1984 F150 300, T18 granny 4 speed and 3.08 axle ratio I once towed a two axle trailer with a 1986 E250 van on it with a bunch of sheet rock inside. Everything together was 11,000 pounds and it definitely felt like it. Another time I towed a 1983 F350 chassis cab dually that weighed 7,000 pounds. I used a huge home made tow bar that is around 8’ long and between 100 and 150 pounds itself. I don’t remember which 300 powered F150 I used to tow that F350. I owned around a dozen mostly 1981-1986 F150’s. All but one had the 300-6.
