>I reused the factory cable for a little while, but since the 1bbl sat higher than the 4bbl, it had to angle down pretty hard to reach the linkage. It was binding all the time and made for difficult driving. Eventually, I just went to the parts store and bought a $15 generic cable and it works great. The bracket you see in the pictures was one I made myself for about $5 and I bolted it to the two holes in the intake that were originally used to bolt to the stock exhaust manifold. It's worked great.

>The reason for the carb orientation is because the two planes in the DP manifold were set up for the primaries and secondaries. The primaries go towards the engine, and the secondaries away. This is because the two planes in the manifold are different. One's about an inch tall and the other is about 1/2 an inch tall. The half inch tall plane has a higher velocity, which helps when the secondaries kick in. If you have the primaries going into the smaller plane, you'll restrict the fuel flow at lower speeds since the velocity won't be there. I think I'm remembering all of that correctly.:toothless
