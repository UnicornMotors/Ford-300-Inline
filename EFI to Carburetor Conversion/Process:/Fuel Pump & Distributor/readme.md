I have an 89 straight six, I want to switch it to a 4 barrel carb. I’m a bit stuck on what I need to do electrical and fuel wise. Any tips or help appreciated👍

you will need to wire in a duraspark module, take the high pressure fuel pump out of the tank and use one that only has around 5 psi, thats all it needs to run.

lostrebel5 thank you I’m doing this for my senior project in school! Thank you so much for the help!

Jesse Thrasher
lostrebel5 are you sure about 5 psi?

lostrebel5
5 to 8 psi is all you need for a carb, any more and you will bypass the floats causing it to flood real bad. @Jesse Thrasher
