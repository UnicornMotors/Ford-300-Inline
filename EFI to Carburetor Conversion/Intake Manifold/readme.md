# Offenhauser works with Stock Exhaust!
"offenhauser C series bolts right up to the stock exhaust manifold. Tried the one barrell(with an adapter plate that I made) but did not notice any difference in power. Switched to the 500cfm edelbrock carb and with header installed it made a big difference, but, no smog checks for 25 year old trucks in Oklahoma. I have heard that 390 or 450 hollies tune well with the 300cid engine."
