>Well, thought this was a fun update, so I thought I'd share.

>Been working on tuning and tweaking the 4bbl for a few months, trying to iron out the kinks, learn how it operates, etc. I had been continually getting more and more nervous because I am required to pass emissions here, and even though I went headlong into a 4bbl upgrade and engine remodification, I had no idea if it'd ever even pass. I took my chances.

>I recently hooked up an O2 sensor into the exhaust to see how it was doing, and it was running really rich. Tuned the jets way down to some 49s, and it seemed to do a lot better. Decided to run it over to an emissions station just to see how it'd do and maybe give myself some guidance on how it was running. I only had to the end of the month, so if it was going to fail I wanted to know by how much and get some clues as to what I could do to fix it.
>Little did I expect, but it passed on my first try! I couldn't believe it. ((It actually failed the idle test but the guy at the shop (who used to be a performance carb tuner) looked at the numbers and told me it was just idling a tad rich. A 1/4 turn on the idle mixture screws fixed that and I was good to go.))

>It actually passed better than the stock 1bbl did. I spent two months last year tweaking that stupid thing to get it to pass, and the Holley 390 passed this year without a hitch with no emissions equipment (except for a cat). Score.
