>All the diagrams for Dura Spark II and Dura Spark III with EEC show a resistor wire in the 'RUN' wire of the ignition switch. Voltage is specified at 5-8v on the BATT terminal of the coil. 12v input isn't necessary for high voltage electronic ignition.

>It depends on the control box - If you have a Blue or Black wire gromet control box you need the resistor. If you have a Red wire gromet you don't need the resistor. The Red gromet controller has better dwell(Current) control and a lower resistance coil.

>The Red gromet control boxes are rare - 98% are blue & black. (we won't mention Yellow gromet boxes they tend to confuse the issue)
