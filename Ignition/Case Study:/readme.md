>I used to have a 300 in my 84 F150. I had the Offenhauser DP with a header and a Holley 390. No doubt it was a great and reliable motor, but it got tired. It started making some noise in the #5 cylinder and I decided it wasn't going to cost much more to do a swap with a motor I built myself. The 460 had way more power and no problems making 500ft-lbs like it was nothing. My mileage is actually better now with the 460. Anyway, for those of you looking for an inexpensive ignition upgrade for the 300 (or any of these Ford motors really), you should try the Chevy HEI swap using stock parts and recurve a Duraspark II distributor. There's a writeup for both here:

I switched to an Accel aftermarket ignition during the 460 swap, but it didn't last long before the module blew up. Went back to the stock HEI and it's still working great. Hope this helps some of you budget builders.
