[Ford 300 4.9L EFI Simplification](https://youtu.be/Pzh0mGW2YZ0)
|I get a lot of questions about these trucks, from guys who are used to carbs and they think they want to throw away all the EFI to make their lives easier. Thats not necessary, and a LOT of what's under the hood can disappear. All modifications done to my truck in my state and county are legal and compliant, but YOU are responsible for what YOU do to your truck.
